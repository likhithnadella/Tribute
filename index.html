                <li class="list-group-item">1875 - Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic<br>

In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1882 - Worked for Continental Edison<br>

In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1882 - Identified Magnetic Induction Field Principle<br>

Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1884 - Moved to United States<br>

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1885 - Nikola Tesla Quit Working for Edison<br>

After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1886 - Began Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing<br>

Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1887 - War of Currents<br>

The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1891 - Patented Tesla Coil<br>

In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1891 - Columbian Exhibition<br>

With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1901 - Construction on Wardenclyffe Tower Began<br>

In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">August 4, 1915 - Files Suit Against Guglielmo Marconi<br>

On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1934 - Particle Beam Research<br>

In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">15713 - Tesla Died<br>

On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>

<li class="list-group-item">1960 - A Tesla Was Defined as a Unit of Measurement

In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B </li>
